Are you mighty?
Are you what you think you are?
Shafting, scraping for an edge
That will push you over
Take what you can get
Not enough to kill your fix
Is it all worth the wait?
To save a penny

Step out
Look up
Look in (I already did)
Look in (I already did)

The rain is falling and my eyes are getting tired
I hope I think to dream
Before I fall asleep

I need to know who dies when we grow
Who pains when we gain
What will it take to show
When will it start, when will it end
If you know more than I, my friend
Well, come on in and we'll begin

And we'll begin toâ€¦
We'll begin!

I need comfort
I need time
[x2]

So on and so on, I breathe on and build on
Who will back me up?
Who will join me in this fight?
I need to know who dies when we grow
Holding back, not letting go
Will never ever let me show

I need comfort
I need time
[x4]

Time! [x4]

We are proud to get away
Some time to think alone
Mixed feelings about the whole thing
Should you come back, should you come back, I don't know

To - Today, it's so hard being alone
I - I can hardly sing
Gotta hold on, hold on: I'm trying

I owe it (dues I'll pay) every day
(I'll recognize) That I wake (from our days) and stay
I'm gonna make it, I'm gonna make it

You got a lot of things to say
That I'm a selfish human being
But I drove alone today
Felt the wind and remembered everything

I - I laughed today
And I'll laugh again tomorrow
I - I count mistakes
But I still gotta find the blessings

I owe it (dues I'll pay) every day
(I'll recognize) That I wake (from our days) and stay
I'm gonna make it

Thinking I'm not happy
Not thinking right
I can't wash this away
Get it out of my mind

Lonely night
All alone, drunk in my bed
Until I close my eyes
Then wake up and find a new day

I owe it (dues I'll pay) every day
(I'll recognize) That I wake (from our days) and stay
I'm gonna make it [x4]
